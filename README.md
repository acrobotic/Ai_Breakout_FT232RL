Overview
---
This repository includes the Eagle design files (schematics and layout) for our [FT232RL Brekout Board][1]. The FT232RL is a 
popular Integrated Circuit (IC) that provides a single-chip USB to asynchronous serial data (UART) transfer interface. This IC is
commonly known as the `FTDI chip` as its manufactured by Future Technology Devices Internationa (FTDI).  

The FT232RL is extremely useful for sending data back and forth between a PC and a microcontroller (such as the ATMega328p 
that's used in the Arduino Uno R3). It can even be used to program the microcontroller whose boot section has been pre-loaded
with a bootloader (e.g., Optiboot).
